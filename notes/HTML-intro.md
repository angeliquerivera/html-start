# HTML Start

## Recap - npm & git

### npm

- nodejs : a cross-platform Javascript run time environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with Javascript.
- npm : "node package manager"; bundled with nodejs; it is a package manager that downloads packages into your project folder into a folder called `node_modules`.
- run time environment: the environment where the program or application is executed

### git

- git : version control system that is built to track changes in any set of files (aka developer friendly time machine).

## Project Setup

1. `npm init`: ran installer
2.

## HTML

- HTML stands for hypertext markup language
- Markup is a system for annotating a document so that different elements in a document are visually distinguishable from one another

## The building blocks

- There are 3 building blocks to the Javascript powered Internet: Javascript, HTML, and CSS

### The role of each block

- HTML: defines the structure of the web content
- CSS: defines the presentation and appearence of the web content
- JS: defines the functionality and behaviors available in the web content

## Package.JSON

- package.json: the "heart" of any node project. It records important data about the current project you're working on. Also defines the dependencies you need, the scripts that are available, and where the entry point to the package is.

## CSS

- CSS: stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- "cascading" comes from the specified priority scheme that is used to determine which style applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.

### Selectors

What is a selector? Give some examples.

- Selector selects the elements that you want to style.
- Examples: div, p, a, h1-h6
- ID selectors are meant to be a one time used thing. You are not supposed to have more than one ID selector throughout the code/content. IDs are meant to be unique.
